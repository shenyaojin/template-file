# template-syjin

This template repo is mainly for the recovery of my system. I might ruin my system by accident time by time. And if this template is useful you could use it for free. 

## latex template

### "latex_temp_no_figure"

This template is a out-of-box template. That means as long as you install the texlive or the core part of latex (especially in arch, including texlive-core texlive-bin texlive-latexextra with pacman) you could successfully compile it. 

Feature: 
- completely compatible with jupoyter notebook section.
- formula/inline formula supporting
- fixing lots of weird bugs in latex, the document would be beautiful
- better sheet supporting
- better figure supporting


## terminal template

It includes zsh and bash, two of the most important terminals in Linux. 

# zsh

.zshrc: include my zsh configuration. Need to install oh-my-zsh first. I also modified the terminal in a fancy style.

# bash
.bashrc: include some important environment variables, like anaconda, gmt, or some geophysical software(Seismic Unix) configuration. Also modified the terminal to a fancy style.

## Source template 
In mainland China, the apt of ubuntu would be really slow. So, changing the source of ubuntu is necessary. I used a widespread script to change the source. According to the license in the script, I could add it for non-commercial use.
